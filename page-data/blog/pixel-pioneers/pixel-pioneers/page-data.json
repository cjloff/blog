This was my first time attending a frontend focused conference and it didnâ€™t disappoint, here are some of my highlights.</p>\n<h2>Rachel Adam: Grids all the way down</h2>\n<p>Rachel gave a fascinating talk on the sub-grid, an upcoming feature in Level 2 of the CSS grid layout specification. In short,  when using <code class=\"language-text\">display: grid</code> only direct children are placed on the layout grid. You can nest grids on the child elements but they have no relationship with the parent grid. Step in <code class=\"language-text\">subgrid</code>, when using this value on <code class=\"language-text\">grid-template-columns</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">grid-template-rows</code> the element inherits the grid tracks of the parent.</p>\n<p>This would be great for even simple layout composition such as matching the height of captions in sibling elements using the parent grid track rather than manually setting a height or using javascript. The only downside is that the browser support is pretty <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-subgrid)\" target=\"_blank\">non-existent</a> for now, still one to watch and you can play around with it on firefox nightly.</p>\n<h2>Lisi Linhart: Practical Web Animation</h2>\n<p>Lisi gave a captivating presentation (with impressive illustrations to boot!) focusing on CSS animations, using the Web Animations API and making animations more performant. Animations are something I use on a regular basis at work, however some of the examples were on another level, with Lisa even creating a animated card for the <a href=\"https://codepen.io/lisilinhart/pen/oROmWB\" target=\"_blank\">pixel pioneers conference</a> ðŸ¤¯.</p>\n<p>My main takeaways are that animating particular properties can be more taxing on the browser for example animating using <code class=\"language-text\">left</code>, or <code class=\"language-text\">margin-left</code> properties causes a complete re-paint of the page whereas animating using <code class=\"language-text\">transform</code> is more performant as it creates a new animation plane/layer.</p>\n<h2>Phil Hawksworth: JamStack</h2>\n<p>My inspiration for using Gatsby and Netlify for my portfolio/blog was taken from this talk. Phil went through the basics of JamStack (JAM standing for Javascript, API and Markup), the philosophy behind it, how it uses no web servers (and the obvious security benefits of this) and pre-built HTML/assets. He even showed how easy it is to continuously deploy JamStack sites through Netlify by deploying an older snapshot of his own blog from a couple of years ago.</p>\n<p>I was quite surprised to see the performance benefits of JamStack sites which serve pre-built HTML over traditional CMS-based solution which have to send off a request to a webserver. Also the added benefit of decoupling the frontend from the backend, this means the responsibilities of managing content (the CMS) and displaying it (the frontend) are separated within the JamStack workflow.</p>\n<h2>In closing</h2>\n<p>I had a great time at pixel pioneers and hope to attend next year. There were other illuminating talks not covered here but luckily for you they were all filmed and are available to view online on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUjXef3rLwaqP_h0htsP-m1r5JqNBBEIM\r\n\" target=\"_blank\">youtube</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Pixel Pioneers","date":"August 20, 2019","description":null}},"previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/an-introduction-to-bem/an-introduction-to-bem/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"An introduction to BEM"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"591cf4f5-0bd5-5bf5-9801-1ccc33b1ee5b","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":"0b36ba3c-4a69-5df8-85e3-7d5f0af534b8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
